3. Notices and Clarifications

3.1 Scope of License
These notices are informational only and do not alter, supersede, or add restrictions to the MIT License above. If a conflict appears to exist, the MIT License text controls.

3.2 High-Risk Activity and Safety Guidance
This software is not designed or certified for use in hazardous environments or high-risk activities (including, without limitation, life-support systems, emergency dispatch, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, nuclear facilities, medical devices, or weapons systems). If you choose to deploy the software in contexts where failure could result in injury, death, or severe environmental or property damage, you are solely responsible for implementing appropriate risk assessments, redundancies, supervision, and safety certifications.

3.3 Robotics-Specific Safety Expectations
The software includes a domain-specific language and tooling that can be used to orchestrate automation and robotics tasks through separate hardware or service modules. The software itself does not control hardware directly and does not provide safety guarantees. You are responsible for validating task logic, guarding dangerous motions, enforcing stop conditions, and complying with applicable safety standards (for example, ISO 10218, ISO/TS 15066, IEC 61508, or regional equivalents). Always test tasks in simulation or restricted modes before live operation. Provide physical e-stop mechanisms and administrative controls when deploying on real systems.

3.4 Third-Party Components and Sub-licenses
This project may include or depend upon third-party packages, tools, or assets. Each third-party component remains subject to its own license. Nothing in this document purports to grant rights to third-party code or trademarks. See the repository’s dependency metadata and the respective upstream license files for details.

3.5 Documentation, Examples, and Sample Assets
Documentation, example scripts, test files, schemas, and sample module manifests are provided to illustrate usage patterns. Unless stated otherwise in their headers, these materials are licensed under the MIT License together with the software. If a file carries a different license header, that header controls for that file.

3.6 Trademarks
"Visual Studio Code" and any Microsoft marks are trademarks or registered trademarks of Microsoft Corporation. Other names and logos may be trademarks of their respective owners. This license does not grant permission to use any trade names, logos, or trademarks of Loop Robotics or any third party.

3.7 Export Compliance
You are responsible for compliance with U.S. and international export laws and regulations that may apply to your use and distribution of the software and any data, models, or hardware you control with it.

3.8 Privacy and Telemetry
This project does not intentionally collect personal data or transmit telemetry on its own. If you enable telemetry features in your editor or platform, their respective privacy policies apply. Scripts you author may send data to services you choose; you are responsible for informing users and meeting applicable privacy obligations.

4. Contribution Terms
By submitting a contribution (including pull requests, issues with patches, or code snippets), you agree that your contribution is licensed under the MIT License and that you have the legal right to submit it. You retain copyright to your contributions. If your employer has rights to the intellectual property you create, you represent that you have received permission to make the contribution on its behalf where required. You agree not to knowingly include third-party content without the appropriate license.

5. Contact
For security or legal inquiries, see the repository homepage for current contact details. If you operate the software in a safety-critical environment, establish your own internal procedures for incident reporting and mitigation.
