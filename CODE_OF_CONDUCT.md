# ROOP Language Support Code of Conduct

This document defines expected behavior for everyone interacting with the ROOP Language Support project and its community spaces. It applies to all contribution types: code and configuration (.roop, .roopmodule.json, TypeScript/JSON), grammar and schemas, documentation, issue reports, discussions, reviews, events, and releases.

## 1. Purpose

The aim of this Code is to maintain an open, welcoming, safe, and professional environment for contributors and users of the ROOP Language Support project. The project exists to help people author reliable robot and automation behaviors using the ROOP DSL; community norms must support collaboration, learning, and safety for everyone.

## 2. Scope

This Code applies in all project spaces and interactions, including but not limited to:

- Source repositories and pull requests.
- Issue trackers, discussions, and community forums.
- Real‑time chat, online meetings, and in‑person events.
- Project websites and documentation.
- Any interaction where a person represents the project or its community.

## 3. Our Standards

### 3.1 Positive Behaviors

- Be respectful, considerate, and patient.
- Assume good intent; seek to understand before responding.
- Provide constructive feedback that focuses on ideas and code, not people.
- Use clear, inclusive, and accessible language in code comments, commit messages, and docs.
- Acknowledge and correct mistakes; document follow‑ups and resolutions.
- Share knowledge generously: explain reasoning, link specifications, and add examples.
- Prioritize user and operator safety when proposing or reviewing behaviors and modules.
- Credit others’ work and cite sources where appropriate.

### 3.2 Unacceptable Behaviors

- Harassment, discrimination, hate speech, or demeaning comments.
- Personal attacks, sustained disruption, or deliberate intimidation.
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Publishing others’ private information without consent.
- Reckless recommendations or “advice” that could compromise safety, privacy, or compliance.
- Repeated one‑upmanship, gatekeeping, or weaponized “nitpicking” that discourages participation.
- Any behavior that violates applicable law, venue rules, or platform policies.

## 4. Community Principles for a Robotics DSL

Because ROOP targets real‑world devices, community behavior must reflect additional responsibilities:

- Openness and collaboration: contributions are welcome from everyone and should be reviewed fairly and transparently.
- Transparency of language and tooling: grammar rules, task semantics, and module interfaces should be understandable and auditable.
- Sharing and reuse: prefer reusable modules, examples, and templates; document versioning and compatibility.
- Safety first: respect boundaries, permissions, and emergency procedures; prefer conservative defaults and clear safeguards.
- Cultural respect and localization: acknowledge global users and contributors; avoid culture‑specific assumptions.
- Learning and mentorship: help newcomers, document rationales, and preserve institutional knowledge.
- Sustainability and stewardship: maintain a long‑term view; keep the ecosystem healthy by avoiding lock‑in and brittle design.

## 5. Inclusive Language and Content Guidelines

- Prefer descriptive, neutral terms in identifiers, UI text, and documentation.
- Avoid slang, sarcasm, and idioms that may not translate or may exclude others.
- Write step‑by‑step instructions that are accessible to different experience levels.
- Provide alternatives for text in images or diagrams; ensure examples compile and run.
- When giving feedback, address the work (“this grammar rule…”), not the person.

## 6. Reporting an Issue or Incident

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have concerns about safety, privacy, or compliance:

- Choose a reporting path you are comfortable with (private or public).
- Provide as much detail as you can while preserving your privacy and safety.
- Reports are handled confidentially; retaliation is not tolerated.

### 6.1 Private and Public Channels

- Private: contact the maintainers through the project homepage contact options or by opening a minimal “Conduct” issue asking for a private follow‑up.
- Public: open an issue with a neutral title (for example, “Conduct report: request moderator review”), include only non‑sensitive details, and ask a maintainer to initiate a private review thread.

### 6.2 What to Include in a Report

- Your account name and contact preference.
- Names of individuals involved, if known.
- When and where the incident occurred (links, message excerpts, dates).
- A concise description of what happened.
- Any context that could help moderators understand impact and risk.
- Any immediate safety concerns.

## 7. Enforcement Policy

The project uses a graduated response model. Actions are chosen based on the severity, persistence, and context of the behavior, aiming to protect the community and help people improve.

### 7.1 Correction

For minor issues (tone, off‑topic, unclear wording), moderators may provide a gentle reminder and guidance. Expected outcome: the person acknowledges and adjusts.

### 7.2 Warning

For more significant or repeated issues, a written warning will be issued. It will describe the problematic behavior, expected changes, and the consequence of further incidents.

### 7.3 Temporary Suspension

For serious or repeated violations, moderators may temporarily restrict participation (for example, muting a thread, limiting issue creation, or temporary ban from the repository or community spaces).

### 7.4 Permanent Suspension

For egregious misconduct, harassment, or behavior that places others at risk, moderators may permanently remove a person from project spaces.

## 8. Maintainer Responsibilities and Escalation Path

- Treat all reports seriously and promptly.
- Maintain confidentiality to the extent possible.
- Recuse from decisions when a conflict of interest exists.
- Document actions taken and communicate outcomes to impacted parties.
- Provide a clear escalation path to a broader maintainers group if a reporter is unsatisfied with the initial handling.

## 9. Safety, Privacy, and Compliance Expectations

ROOP is used to express commands for machines that may move, grasp, or otherwise affect the physical world. As such:

- Never encourage or approve unsafe practices, shortcuts, or “workarounds” that bypass safety interlocks or privacy protections.
- Prefer defaults that minimize harm: conservative speeds, explicit permissions, clear abort paths.
- Treat logs, telemetry, and user data as sensitive; redact or anonymize when sharing.
- Do not post real‑world access credentials, API keys, or location data.
- Follow export control and licensing rules when sharing modules, models, or datasets.

## 10. Moderation Tools and Labels

Moderators may use repository tools to maintain a healthy environment, including locking discussions, editing or removing harmful content, requesting changes, closing or redirecting off‑topic issues, and applying labels such as “conduct”, “safety”, or “confidential”.

## 11. Appeals

If you believe an action was taken in error or without adequate context, you may appeal by replying to the decision notice or by requesting a private review with additional information. Appeals will be heard by maintainers not involved in the original decision whenever possible.

## 12. Attribution and License of This Document

This Code is inspired by widely adopted community codes of conduct and adapted for the needs of a robotics‑focused DSL. It may be reused under the same license as this repository.

## 13. Amendments

This document may be updated by project maintainers to reflect evolving community needs. Substantive changes will be announced in the repository.
